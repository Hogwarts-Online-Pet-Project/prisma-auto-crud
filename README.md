# Prisma Auto CRUD

An express middleware that generates routes and CRUD controllers for every table defined in a prisma schema.

## Development notes
 * using [Prisma generators](https://github.com/YassinEldeeb/create-prisma-generator) could be a better approach 
 * Although a list of the tables is available by looking into the prisma client keys, the schema of each table is yet to be found.
